        <h2>Business Understanding</h2>
        <p>
            Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
            They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
            n the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].
            This database is also available through the UW CS ftp server: ftp ftp.cs.wisc.edu cd math-prog/cpo-dataset/machine-learn/WDBC/
